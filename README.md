# Serius-IDE
This is to be a generic, open source IDE that can support all facets of specific frameworks, languages, and environments. 
It is developed mostly in C#.NET. Specific forks may be used for new language/framework support. 

This is meant to break the barrier for those developers wishing to learn/develop-in a new language or framework but do not have the money to start out. 
Editors are great, but IDEs support so much more of the development experience.
